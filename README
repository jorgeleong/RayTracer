This is my RayTracer program 
I have worked on something similar to this program last semester, but I feel this one is more my style.
The other implementation I was contributing to didn't reflect my coding style.

You'll see a lot of operator overloading - one of my favorite techniques - as well as using a header file to implement.
Unorthodox, but for trial runs of my implementations I found that it works great. When I submit code however, I follow
the standards for the language. In this case I'd be making a .cpp file for any header file that requires implementation.


There are some files which I had to build based on online tutorials, others are based on my knowledge from the course I took.
Overall it's pretty much a great practice for anyone looking into working with object oriented programming and graphics.
